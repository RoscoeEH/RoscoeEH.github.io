            <p>Hi! I studied computer science and math at Reed College and currently work in information security. Within the realm of computer science I am interested in cryptography, cyber-security, low level systems and computer networking to name a few. Outside of that, I hold many scattered interests including but not limited to: rock climbing, weightlifting and painting. Below are descriptions and links to a few projects that are either more recent, ongoing, or took a disproportionate amount of work. You may look at my full <a href="https://github.com/RoscoeEH">GitHub Profile</a> if that is of interest.</p>

            <h2>My Projects</h2>
            <ul>
              
              <li>
                    <h3><a href="https://github.com/RoscoeEH/Captcha-solver" target="_blank">Captcha Solver using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network</a></h3>
                    <p>I used PyTorch implement a CNN and LSTM that solves captchas. The captchas are generated using the python captcha module, each one corresponds to a random alphanumeric string between 5-8 characters. After training, the performance is evaluated and parameters are adjusted to better optimize training</a>.</p>

                    <h3><a href="https://github.com/RoscoeEH/PasswordManager" target="_blank">Rust Password Manager</a></h3>
                    <p>An async client-server application written in Rust that stores encrypted passwords on the server and sends the ciphertext to the client to be decrypted locally. The encryption is done with 256-bit AES-GCM. The AES key is generated via PBKDF. No plaintext keys are transmitted or stored on the server at any time. This is done with a number of other Rust packages including Rust-Crypto (cryptography), Tokio (client-server functionality), Serde (serialization), RocksDB (long-term storage), and Ratatui (terminal UI).</p>

                    <h3><a href="https://github.com/RoscoeEH/ZeroKnowledgeProofForNorinori/blob/main/Roscoe_Thesis.pdf" target="_blank">A ZK-Proof for Norinori</a></h3>
                    <p>For my undergraduate thesis I developed a zero-knowledge proof for the pen-and-paper game Norinori and proved that it meets the criteria of a cryptographic ZK-proof. Linked is a pdf copy of my thesis. I could give a further description, but I fear if I start this will become far too long. If you are interested, I suggest you go read the abstract to learn more.</p>

                    <h3><a href="https://github.com/RoscoeEH/Minesweeper-Solver/tree/main" target="_blank">Simple Minesweeper with Linear Algebra Solver</a></h3>
                    <p>I really enjoy the game minesweeper. It was my go to game to subtly play on my computer during school since I was in 9th grade. The idea is to write a simple playable version of minesweeper and then a solver to solve a given board, both implemented in Python. The solver would first take the naive approach of marking all obvious bombs and clearing the easily viewed non-bombs. Next, it would use Gaussian Elimination to determine the locations of more bombs and start from step 1. If no squares can be determined completely, it will then go to probabilistic analysis to determine what the best guess is. Using those steps, it will have a decent shot at clearing any board.</p>

                    <h3><a href="https://github.com/RoscoeEH/automated-plant-watering" target="_blank">Plant Moisture Sensors Run on Raspberry Pi</a></h3>
                    <p>I have a series of plants across my house and I always check if they need water by sticking my finger in the soil to feel if it is dry. This is my attempt to automate that process. I have a Raspberry Pi connected to moisture sensors that determine the level, then send an email reporting which ones need water. These are the Python scripts run on the device.</p>
